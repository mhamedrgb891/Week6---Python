# Week 6 – Python Programming

Part of CS50x 2025 – Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University

## Overview
This week introduced Python and its simpler syntax compared to C. The goal was to refactor previous logic using Python's built-in features and dynamic typing.

## Topics Covered
- Python syntax and indentation
- Dynamic typing
- Lists, dictionaries, and string handling
- File I/O

## Projects
- Mario (Python)
- Cash (Python)
- Credit (Python)
- Readability (Python)

## Key Takeaways
- Improved productivity using Python's concise syntax.
- Understood dynamic memory management without manual allocation.
- Practiced rewriting algorithms using Python’s built-in capabilities.

## Challenges
Rewriting the credit card validation logic from C to Python required a shift in mindset to use Pythonic approaches.

## How to Run
```bash
python filename.py
